Role at TCS iON: Data Scientist

During my tenure at TCS iON, I was selected to lead the "Intelligent Property Analyzer" project. This initiative was aimed at developing a machine learning-powered automated system designed to enhance real estate analytics. Utilizing my expertise in Python and its associated libraries, I spearheaded the creation of a sophisticated model capable of predicting housing property prices based on a multitude of factors.

Project Overview: Intelligent Property Analyzer

The core objective of this project was threefold: a) Develop a predictive model to estimate the market value of real estate properties using machine learning algorithms, ensuring the system could analyze various property-related factors to predict prices with high accuracy. b) Design an intuitive Web UI that allows users to input property details easily and access predictive insights, enhancing user engagement and accessibility. c) Engineer a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning system, trained on extensive datasets to ensure reliability and accuracy in real-world applications.

Throughout this project, I leveraged my strong programming skills in Python, my proficiency with MySQL databases, and my experience with web development frameworks like Django and Flask to deliver a robust and user-friendly analytics tool. This system not only supports real estate professionals in making informed decisions but also aligns with TCS iONâ€™s mission to revolutionize sectors through digital innovation.
