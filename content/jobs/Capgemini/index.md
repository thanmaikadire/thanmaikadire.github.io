- Capgemini, headquartered in Paris, is one of the leading consulting companies globally, renowned for its expertise in delivering innovative solutions that tackle complex business challenges. As a top consulting firm in both India and the United States, Capgemini enables organizations across these major markets to embrace emerging technologies and drive digital transformation at scale, enhancing their competitive edge in the digital era.

During my tenure at Capgemini, I specialized in applying sophisticated data analytics techniques to revolutionize human resources strategies. I developed and deployed predictive models using Python and SQL to analyze trends in employee attrition and retention. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, I extracted actionable insights from employee feedback, enabling more targeted and effective interventions. My initiatives dramatically improved workforce management by forecasting turnover trends, optimizing recruitment processes, and boosting overall employee satisfaction and engagement. Through these efforts, I contributed significantly to Capgemini's capability to maintain a highly motivated and efficient workforce, aligned with the organization's strategic objectives for digital transformation and technological advancement.
